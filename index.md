# BÄNG BOOM BÄNG
The part-time criminal Keek has lost most of the money from a bank robbery that he committed together with the now jailed Kalle Grabowski.
When Kalle watches a porn-movie in jail, shot by Keek's friend Franky, he sees his wife Manuela starring in the movie, Kalle goes crazy and escapes from prison. Before killing Franky, the escaped Kalle unexpectedly appears at Keek's door and demands his money.
The next day, the alcoholic Schlucke is forced by his boss Werner Kampmann, to break into his transport company to pretend a burglary because of insurance fraud. Schlucke, however, has talked boastfully about his plan, so that Keek sees a chance to get the money for Kalle. Together with his friend Andy, Schlucke and Ratte (another fellow criminal) break into the company. Because Keek has his Thumb ripped off and locked in the safe during the safecracking attempt, Keek and Andy pull the safe out by tying it to a chain attached to Keek's car, leading to an iconic picture from a speeding camera.
